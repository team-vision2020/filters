# Inversion
Cem's working on this component. Right now the setup randomly generates 3x3 images, filters them
and pushes them filtered image and the center of the original image to a 64^3-layered NN.

A model for Gingham is trained and available in the repo. Models for the other filters will be
available soon.

Final step on this project will involve a nice web app that applies the NNs on given images.
